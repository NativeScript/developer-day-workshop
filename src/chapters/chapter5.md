## Forms

Forms are the basis of many mobile applications. In this challenge-based section, you’ll build a form to submit data to a backend system. Plus, there are rewards if you can complete the challenges 😀.

<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Start up a new app
</h4>

Go ahead and start up a new NativeScript app for this workshop:

```
tns create NativeScriptForms --ng
```

Next, change directories into your new project:

```
cd NativeScriptForms
```

<div class="exercise-end"></div>

To earn a gift card:
  - Allow the user to submit the form with the four fields on the screenshots. Don’t worry how the data is formatted when you send it the backend—just get the thing to submit.

Bonus points:
  - Improve on our very basic design, perhaps using the new NativeScript core theme.
  - Disable the form when you submit.
  - Show an activity indicator while submitting.
  - Show an alert after the form successfully submits.
  - Make all fields mandatory.
